# Heart Disease Prediction Model
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset 

# Data
The dataset includes a variety of medical and demographic features that can influence heart health, such as age, gender, types of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and results from electrocardiogram tests. Additionally, it contains indicators related to exercise and thalassemia, along with the target variable that indicates whether or not an individual has heart disease.

This combination of features allows us to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease, providing valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart health.

# Try it yourself
If you have access to your own medical data, you are encouraged to apply this model to see how it performs on your personal information. This could offer a unique perspective on your heart health, though itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for any medical advice or diagnosis.
