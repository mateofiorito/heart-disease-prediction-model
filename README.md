# Heart Disease Prediction Model
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset
